## Abstract
Human recombination maps are a valuable resource for association and linkage studies and crucial for many inferences of population history and natural selection. Existing maps are based solely on crossover (CO) recombination, omitting the more common form of recombination – non-crossovers (NCOs) – due to the difficulty in detecting them. Using whole-genome sequence (WGS) data in families, we estimate the number of NCOs transmitted from parent to offspring and derive complete, sex-specific recombination maps including both NCOs and COs. Mothers have fewer but longer NCOs than fathers, and oocytes accumulate NCOs in a non-regulated fashion with maternal age.  Recombination, primarily NCO, is responsible for 1.8% (95% CI: 1.3-2.3) and 11.3% (95% CI: 9.0-13.6) of paternal and maternal de novo mutations (DNMs), respectively, and may drive the increase in DNMs with maternal age. NCOs are substantially more prominent than COs in centromeres, possibly to avoid large-scale genomic changes that may cause aneuploidy.  Our results demonstrate that NCOs highlight, to a much greater extent than COs, the differences in the meiotic process between the sexes, where maternal NCOs may reflect the safeguarding of oocytes from infancy till ovulation.
